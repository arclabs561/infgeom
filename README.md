# infgeom

Information geometry primitives.

`logp` provides divergence/entropy functionals on the simplex; `infgeom` builds **geometric**
structure on top (metrics, distances, and later projections/dual connections) without mixing in
application policy.

Initial focus:
- Fisher–Rao / Rao distance for categorical distributions (simplex), via the sphere embedding.

Background reading:
- Frank Nielsen’s “Information geometry and divergences” portal: https://franknielsen.github.io/IG/index.html
